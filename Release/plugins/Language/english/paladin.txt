This planet has been selected for your pilgrimage, the punishment for the sins committed towards your people<s>, K        </s>.\"\n\nI stared ahead, stripped of my armor and my sword.  My crown, shattered.  My obsidian-stone carapace, damaged and torn.  A small, starry gemstone embedded in my right palm, a remnant of my past as king.  They keep me bound and push me towards a ship, end of the line, my sacrifice for the good of my brothers and sisters.\n\nI did it to save my people, even if they do not accept such niceties.  I would not fall into their habits of never-ending war and suffering.  I tried to change them for the betterment of themselves, but I learned the hard way that traditionalism is something that one alone cannot change.\n\nSo be it.  Perhaps my message will live on in the minds of those who tried to defend me.  Maybe my actions will mean something, maybe they will result in nothing.  I do not care for my own fate, I only hope that my people will learn from their pasts and improve themselves.\n\nFor the sake of my people, for the sake of our history, for the sake of longevity...\n\nTo the stars I go... to this planet of hushed rumors.",
