## Overview
The Paladin is a tanky melee hybrid survivor who uses a combination of powerful melee attacks and long range spells. Writing these descriptions is time consuming so just try the character out for yourself and find out what works. He's got enough skills and flexibility to support a myriad of different playstyles.

## Skin Mod Devs:
See the [Custom Skin wiki](https://github.com/ArcPh1r3/PaladinMod/wiki/Custom-Skin-Stuff) tab on github  
If you'd like to make a paladin skin, there's some extra skin features for Paladin you can/should take advantage of.  
Thanks to those that have made skins for the man, and sorry they all broke 2.0.0. Reach out if you need help updating them to the new rig [here](https://github.com/ArcPh1r3/PaladinMod/blob/master/Blend/Paladin_rig_for_skins.blend). 

## VR
Paladin is now compatible with [Dr.Bibop's VRMod](https://thunderstore.io/package/DrBibop/VRMod/). (*Thanks PureDark!*)  
Make sure you have [VRAPI installed](https://thunderstore.io/package/DrBibop/VRAPI/).  

**Primary:**
 - can be activated by swinging your sword.
 - your sword beam will go in your look direction, and follow the orientation of your swing

**Secondary:**
 - goes in the direction you're facing

**Spells:**
 - aimed with their respective hand

Any issues or feedback on VR-side, definitely reach out.
